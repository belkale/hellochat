# hellochat

Simple dummy chat application example. Mainly allows us to experiment with streams and 
asynchronous programming.

## Getting Started

Start the chat server server.py using Python. This starts a chat server socket stream.
Update main.dart to use the correct ip address and the port of the server. Flutter application
talks to this chat server and updates the UI.
